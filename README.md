# Sandbox

My plans for this repository are to practice what I've been learning as I attempt to improve my coding skills.

Here's a list of some of the languages and frameworks I'm working with.  I'm more comfortable with some than others but I hope that keeping a repository of some of my experiments will help me to see my own progress over time.  most items will be small projects based on tutorials that I modified with my own ideas.

- HTML5
- CSS3
- CSS Flexbox
- Bootstrap
- JavaScript

I'm pretty comfortable with HTML5 and CSS3 I have some understanding of Flexbox and Bootstrap, and am totally new to JavaScript.

I want to delve into the following over time...

- JQuery
- Angular
- Node.js

I won't start working on these until I've got a good handle on JavaScript fundamentals, so the second list is a long ways down the road based on where I'm at now.
